    u return the and gives the token with 24 number then the parkboy checks the 
    entry then find the car then return u.
}

e.g{
    client = when a client wants to access the the server , server sends the session uid
            to client.
    =>      when he comes to GET /users | uid: 345
    =>      { servers check the user is exists and check the state and authenticate}
    <=>     {then if the uid matches with state check then it will response : all users }
